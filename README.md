SHIPMENT SUCCESS METRICS DASHBOARD
In a comprehensive logistics case study, I analyzed delivery performance metrics focusing on On-time in-full (OTIF) to identify trends and improve operational efficiency. By categorizing delivery statuses into Early, On-time, and Late, I discovered that 58.64% of deliveries were classified as Early. The analysis highlighted top-performing salespersons and cities, which informed strategic improvements to enhance customer satisfaction. Additionally, I explored the impact of various service channels on delivery performance, leading to actionable insights. Collaborating with cross-functional teams, I implemented data-driven strategies that significantly improved overall logistics operations.
